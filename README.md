# voxel-terrain-finally
Ive been working on making it to this tutorial video for quite some time now. How to make a voxel terrain with hills and all.  There were many obstacles to overcome, like the fact that a single mesh has a vertex limit of 64K, so that's why we make chunks of voxels. then with chunks of voxels, how do I apply the perlin noise algorithm to make the hills? How do I quickly determine which voxel in a mesh is selected by the user? how do I determine the space beside a voxel to add a voxel for the user?  and how do I do thus all reasonably fast?   Well, I have come to some satisfaction of answers for all those questions. I will reveal them to you here in this video!!  I know there is still more to figure out, like trees and caves and random placement of deposits of coal and minerals in the terrain, but let me enjoy this milestone for now.
